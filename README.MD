# dsprot

This is a decompilation of DS Protect, an antipiracy library for the Nintendo DS. This is likely version 1.10 (unconfirmed), as it appears in Japanese versions of Pok√©mon HeartGold and SoulSilver as overlay 122. 

This library is designed to detect if a DS game is running on an emulator or flashcart. What happens after it detects that is up to the game that is integrating it: HeartGold and SoulSilver will leak memory until the game eventually crashes.

The existence, mechanics, and effects of DS Protect have been documented as early as 2009 ([link](https://gbatemp.net/threads/seeking-help-for-anti-piracy-protection-removal.134683/post-1768816), [link](https://sourceforge.net/p/desmume/bugs/979/), [link](https://opentrackers.org/scenerules.org/html/2010_NDSr.html)).

Supposedly, at least 500 DS titles use DS Protect in some form.

For instructions to build the library see [BUILD.MD](./BUILD.MD).

For documentation of its inner workings, see [FUNCTIONALITY.MD](./doc/FUNCTIONALITY.MD) (also [ENCODING.MD](./doc/ENCODING.MD) and [ASSEMBLY.MD](./doc/ASSEMBLY.MD)).

## TODO

- Verify it actually works with Wine.
